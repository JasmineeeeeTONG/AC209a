If we take all possible interactions that will lead to an inordinate number $\\binom{46}{4} + \\binom{45}{3} + \\binom{44}{2} + \\binom{43}{1} = 178364$ interactions.  We aim to decrease this a bit by considering the interactions that we think matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all it doesn't make sense to consider polynomial terms of categorical variables (particularly in the one hot encoding form) since they have powers of a binary categorical variable take on the same value of that categorical variable.  Not considering these terms will decrease our total number of variables significantly.  In addition we can approximate our full interaction fit by only worrying about bilateral interactions between variables (i.e. in the universe of interactions between two variables $X_1$ and $Y_1$ $\\{X_1Y_1, X_1^2Y_1, X_1Y_1^2, X_1^2Y_1^2 \\ldots\\}$ only worrying about $X_1Y_1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these steps decrease our total number of interactions/variables to $\\approx 418$. Even with this more manageable augmented set of predictors the total number of features $\\gg$ the number of data points.  The assumptions that underly OLS no longer apply and we can expect extreme overfitting at best.  Techniques like Ridge Regression and Lasso won't work well either (although Elastic Net may work well)."

    "One potential attempt is to treat this like backwards subselection but on data points instead of predictors. Let's select outliers one by one by finding the data point whose removal results in the best fitting as determined by AIC.  Remove it and repeat until we've removed 20% of points or removing an additional point won't decrease AIC.  Other options include using some other measure such as magnitude of the residual or impact on $R^2$ to determine whether a point is an outlier.  Ideally an answer would evaluate the effect of the data point being removed rather than purely calculating the measure (e.g. magnitude of residual) of the data point."

    "The two models are very similar and give quite similar regression lines (and beta parameters) which isn't surprising.  The student's t is very similar to a normal except it has \"fatter tails\" which should in principle make it more robust to outliers. From visual inspection the beer data set doesn't have much in the way of outliers but to the extent that the student-t regression line differs from the OLS regression line it may be due to the student t regression line being less sensitive to some potential outlier points (near (0,0), (1,10) and (1,11) "
